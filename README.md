# Bench_Calculator
This is a simple calculator that takes in an input which is infix expression and converts it into postfix expression and then outputs the answer. This programme also makes use of a stack of doubles and fuctions such as push(), pop(), check_Empty() and prec() which push things on to the stack, pops things off of the stack, checks if the stack is empty and checks for precedence of operators respectively.
